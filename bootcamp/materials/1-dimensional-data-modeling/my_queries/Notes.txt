SCD

Entire History
Step 1 : Get the previous value using LAG()
Step 2 : Build as Change Indicator based on condition  ‘Current Value’ <> ‘Previous Value’>
Step 3 : Calculate streak, I.e., sum (change indicator) over(partition by player order by current_season)
Step 4 : GROUP BY aggregation with MIN() and MAX() gives the the SCD table 


Incremental History
-- Step 1 : Latest records from SCD table will be 'Yesterday' 
-- Step 2 : Get current records from source table => 'Today'
-- Step 3 : Historic records from SCD table
-- Step 4 : Unchanged Records from 'yesterday' and 'today'
-- Step 5 : Changed Records between 'Yesterday' and 'Today'
--			Note: We need to create 2 records here, one for the closed records, ie., between Start_DATE and End_DATE
--					and A new cords for the 'changed' value
-- Step 6 : Un-nest the Changed records
-- Step 7 : New Records
